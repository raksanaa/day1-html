    <h2 id="biology">Biology</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Biology</b> is the study of life. It deals with cells, tissues, organisms,
        evolution, genetics, and ecosystems. Life is organized into levels—from the simplest
        molecules to complex organisms and entire ecosystems.Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. It is a broad natural science that encompasses a wide range of fields and unifying principles that explain the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of life. Central to biology are five fundamental themes: the cell as the basic unit of life, genes and heredity as the basis of inheritance, evolution as the driver of biological diversity, energy transformation for sustaining life processes, and the maintenance of internal stability (homeostasis).[1][2]

Biology examines life across multiple levels of organization, from molecules and cells to organisms, populations, and ecosystems. Subdisciplines include molecular biology, physiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, developmental biology, and systematics, among others. Each of these fields applies a range of methods to investigate biological phenomena, including observation, experimentation, and mathematical modeling. Modern biology is grounded in the theory of evolution by natural selection, first articulated by Charles Darwin, and in the molecular understanding of genes encoded in DNA. The discovery of the structure of DNA and advances in molecular genetics have transformed many areas of biology, leading to applications in medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and environmental science.

Life on Earth is believed to have originated over 3.7 billion years ago.[3] Today, it includes a vast diversity of organisms—from single-celled archaea and bacteria to complex multicellular plants, fungi, and animals. Biologists classify organisms based on shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships, using taxonomic and phylogenetic frameworks. These organisms interact with each other and with their environments in ecosystems, where they play roles in energy flow and nutrient cycling. As a constantly evolving field, biology incorporates new discoveries and technologies that enhance the understanding of life and its processes, while contributing to solutions for challenges such as disease, climate change, and biodiversity loss.
    </p>
    <p>
        Biology also explores how organisms interact with their environment, how traits are inherited,
        and how species evolve over time. The <mark>cell</mark> is considered the basic unit of life,
        while <i>DNA</i> carries genetic information. Understanding these concepts helps explain how life works.

    <!-- Physics Section -->
    <h2 id="physics">Physics</h2>
    <p>
        <i>Physics</i> studies matter, motion, energy, and forces. It explains natural phenomena such as
        gravity, light, sound, electricity, and magnetism. Physics forms the base of many modern technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is divided into branches such as classical mechanics, thermodynamics, optics, quantum physics,
        and nuclear physics. The <b>laws of motion</b> discovered by Newton and the theories of Einstein have
        shaped our understanding of the universe. Physics helps us understand everything from atoms to galaxies.Physics is the scientific study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.[1] It is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines.[2][3][4] A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist.

Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines.[5] Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, these natural sciences branched into separate research endeavors. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences[2] and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.

    <!-- Chemistry Section -->
    <h2 id="chemistry">Chemistry</h2>
    <p>
        <mark>Chemistry</mark> is the study of matter and how it changes. It explains atoms, molecules,
        chemical reactions, bonding, acids, bases, and periodic table properties. Chemistry plays an important
        role in medicine, agriculture, food, fuels, and manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The study of chemistry includes organic chemistry (carbon compounds), inorganic chemistry,
        physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, and biochemistry. Chemical reactions follow specific
        laws such as conservation of mass and definite proportions. Understanding chemistry helps us
        develop medicines, fertilizers, polymers, and everyday materials.Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter.[1][2] It is a physical science within the natural sciences that studies the chemical elements that make up matter and compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during reactions with other substances.[3][4][5][6] Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds.

In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology.[7] It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.[8] For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the Moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).
